> This repository is currently under development and is not ready for production use. üõ†Ô∏è It's a work in progress, and I'm actively working on enhancing its functionality and features.

This application was created as a pet project to improve Java, Spring, and Apache Solr development skills, as well as to
learn Vue. It showcases the functionality of a search system based on Apache Solr, with the backend implemented in Java
and Spring Boot, and the frontend using Vue.

Based on [**@jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs**](https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs). Go give him a star ‚≠ê
